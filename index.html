    <section id="acknowledgement">
        <h2>Acknowledgement</h2>
        <p>I would like to express my sincere thanks to my Geography teacher for guiding us throughout this project. I am also thankful to my school for providing necessary resources. I thank my parents and friends for their support and cooperation in completing this project successfully.</p>

    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Natural vegetation means plants that grow naturally without human help. These plants grow according to climate, soil, rainfall, and landforms. Wildlife includes animals, birds, reptiles, insects, and other living beings that depend on forests and natural areas for survival.</p>
        <p>India is rich in natural vegetation and wildlife because it has different climates such as hot, cold, wet, and dry regions. Forests and wildlife are very important because they provide oxygen, food, shelter, and maintain balance in nature. Without forests and wildlife, life on Earth would become very difficult.</p>
        <p>This project explains different types of natural vegetation and wildlife in India, their importance, problems faced by them, and ways to protect them.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="objectives">
        <h2>Objectives of the Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To understand natural vegetation and wildlife</li>
            <li>To study different types of forests in India</li>
            <li>To learn the importance of forests and wildlife</li>
            <li>To understand threats and conservation methods</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
        <p>This project is prepared using different sources of information. The main source is the NCERT Geography textbook. Additional information was collected from reference books, educational websites, newspapers, and class notes. Discussions with teachers and group members also helped in understanding the topic clearly. The collected information is written in simple words for easy understanding.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="meaning-importance">
        <h2>Natural Vegetation – Meaning and Importance</h2>
        <p>Natural vegetation includes forests, grasslands, and shrubs that grow naturally. Forests play a very important role in our life. They provide oxygen which is essential for breathing. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and reduce air pollution.</p>
        <p>Forests help in controlling climate and rainfall. They prevent soil erosion by holding the soil with their roots. Forests are also a source of food, wood, fuel, medicines, rubber, and other useful products. Many animals depend on forests for shelter and food.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="factors">
        <h2>Factors Affecting Natural Vegetation</h2>
        <p>The growth of natural vegetation depends on many factors:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Climate: Hot and wet climate supports dense forests.</li>
            <li>Rainfall: Areas with heavy rainfall have thick forests.</li>
            <li>Temperature: Different plants grow in different temperatures.</li>
            <li>Soil: Fertile soil helps plants grow well.</li>
            <li>Relief: Mountains, plains, and plateaus support different vegetation.</li>
            <li>Human Activities: Cutting trees and farming affect forests.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="types">
        <h2>Types of Natural Vegetation in India</h2>
        <p>India has five major types of natural vegetation based on climate and landforms:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Tropical Evergreen Forests</li>
            <li>Tropical Deciduous Forests</li>
            <li>Thorn Forests and Scrub Vegetation</li>
            <li>Montane Forests</li>
            <li>Mangrove Forests</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each type of forest has different plants and animals.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="evergreen">
        <h2>Tropical Evergreen Forests</h2>
        <p>These forests are found in areas with heavy rainfall. Trees remain green throughout the year. They are found in the Western Ghats and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Important trees include ebony and mahogany.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="deciduous">
        <h2>Tropical Deciduous Forests</h2>
        <p>These are the most widespread forests in India. Trees shed leaves during the dry season. They are divided into moist and dry deciduous forests. Teak and sal are common trees.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="thorn">
        <h2>Thorn Forests and Scrub Vegetation</h2>
        <p>These forests grow in dry areas with low rainfall. Plants have long roots and thorns to reduce water loss. They are found in Rajasthan and Gujarat.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="montane">
        <h2>Montane Forests</h2>
        <p>Montane forests are found in mountainous regions. Vegetation changes with altitude. Pine and deodar trees are common in these forests.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mangrove">
        <h2>Mangrove Forests</h2>
        <p>Mangrove forests grow in coastal regions and river deltas. They protect coastal areas from floods and soil erosion. Sundari trees are common mangroves.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="wildlife">
        <h2>Wildlife of India</h2>
        <p>India is rich in wildlife. Animals like tiger, elephant, lion, and deer are found in forests. Birds like peacock and eagle are also common. Wildlife helps maintain the food chain.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="endangered">
        <h2>Endangered Species of India</h2>
        <p>Endangered species are animals that are at risk of extinction. Examples include tiger, one-horned rhinoceros, and Asiatic lion. Habitat loss and poaching are major reasons.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="parks">
        <h2>National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries</h2>
        <p>National parks and wildlife sanctuaries are protected areas. They help conserve wildlife. Examples include Jim Corbett National Park and Kaziranga National Park.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="threats">
        <h2>Threats to Natural Vegetation and Wildlife</h2>
        <p>Major threats include deforestation, poaching, pollution, urbanization, and climate change. These activities reduce forest cover and endanger animals.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="research">
        <h2>Research Work and Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>Data shows that forest cover is decreasing due to human activities. Wildlife population is also declining. Conservation is urgently needed.</p>
    </section>
